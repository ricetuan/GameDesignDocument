##Plan for 7/14 week
* Implement basic physics world
  * add ball with physics
  * ball collision
* Implement single player game scene
* Designing basic level of Map

##Weekly Review
First 2 days learns some basic of physics and flow control . Next 2 days I try to  revise the asset and and improve the program architecture . Last day I decide to change the game logic Since I'd like to make full use of art set.
###Keep:
revising the assets also takes me so much times. I think the objective of this training program is not for polishing the asset (although it is important and essencial for making games). So I bought an asset and change the game logic using the current asset. I believe it is a good decision to make least time to deal with art But take more time for game logic.
###Problem & TRY:
It take times to change the code because of the change of usage. The problem is that even iterative development needs a specific goal.  I will try to avoid this problem by make the design and game control fixed before starting write code. 
Also try to seperate the task into subtask and use git to keep track of coding.

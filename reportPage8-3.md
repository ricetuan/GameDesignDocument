##Weekly Report
Finish shipping the Game in Friday!!!Maybe every one worked hard in this week which just affected me a lot. Anyway, it is a great improvement for me since i have never work every day till midnight.focusing on one goal and make best effort is realy fun and enjoyable. However, for organization may be it is not a good choice. Every task should be ordered or try to ordered in a best way. crunch mode is not good for a company
